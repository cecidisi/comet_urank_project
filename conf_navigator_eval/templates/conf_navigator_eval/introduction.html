                    uRank Conference Navigator is a recommender system that aims at helping you find interesting papers at UMAP 2017. We combine information from papers' content and user profiles and present it in a visual inteface. The UI allows you to explore features (keywords and other users) and discover relevant papers for you.
                </p>
                <p class="intro">
